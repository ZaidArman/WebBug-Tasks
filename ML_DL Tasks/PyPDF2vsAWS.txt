Question 2(1): 
	Write Critical Finding about pypdf2 Library and AWS Textract, its benefits and usage with any real time example (findings should not be more than 100 lines).

Answer:

PyPDF2:
	PyPDF2 is a python library used for performing major tasks on PDF files such as extracting the document-specific information(Author, Producer, Created_Date, Company_Name etc), merging the PDF files, splitting the pages of a PDF file, adding watermarks to a file, encrypting and decrypting the PDF files, etc.

Benefits of PyPDF2:
	- Helps in extracting metadata of pdf.
	- Helps in extracting text from pdf.
	- Helps in merging and splitting of pdf.
	- Free of Cost

AWS Textract: 
	Amazon Web Service Textract (AWS Textract) is a machine learning (ML) service that automatically extracts text, handwriting, and data from scanned documents.
AWS Textract becomes the top performer by an almost perfect (99.3%) text accuracy level with a narrow confidence interval.


Benefits of AWS Textract: 
	- Easy to integrate with existing application
	- Scalable documents analysis service
	- No human intervention is required.
	- Ready to use
	- OCR, extract structured data like, Tables, Forms, and Expense related documents.

Usage: 
	- Hospitals
	- Educatons
	- Marketing
	- Social Media
	- Business etc

Real-time example: 
	1) - Nanonets: A platform (Nanonets) who works on Optical Character Recognition(OCR) use to deal with Handwriting Recognition using Machine Learning. OCR has been considered a solved problem there is one key component of it, Handwriting Recognition (Handwriting OCR) or Handwritten Text Recognition(HTR) which is still considered a challenging problem statement.

	2) - Apache Tika: The Apache Tika toolkit detects and extracts metadata and text from over a thousand different file types (such as PPT, XLS, and PDF). All of these file types can be parsed through a single interface, making Tika useful for search engine indexing, content analysis, translation, and much more.
